# BlackJack-Game
This project uses java to simulate casino style two-player game of Blackjack, putting a player against a dealer. 
The player will draw cards first. If the player busts, the dealer automatically wins the game without receiving the cards. 
Otherwise, the dealer draws cards and the points of the player and dealer are compared.
